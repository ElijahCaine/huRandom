    <p class="about_content_hr">
In October of 2014 it dawned upon me that I had no idea what it took to justify
a number being 'random' or 'non-random'. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness"
class="main_link_hr">Wikipedia defines Statistical randomness</a> as being 'A
numeric sequence containing no recognizable patterns or regularities.'; for
example, the digits of Ï€ and the result of a dice roll are statistically
random.
    </p>

    <p class="about_content_hr">
Around this time I was also learning about the Linux special files <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random"
class="main_link_hr">`/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom`</a>; one of which streams
out truly random data while the other streams out psuedo-random data. Although
I knew from looking at their documentation that one was truly random and the
other was not when you print out the values produced by both there was no
difference.
    </p>

    <p class="about_content_hr">
This got me to ask the question "How random is the human random number
generator?" I would assume we're not truly random because we love to find and
use patterns even in things that don't have any, but if you got a crowd of
tens, hundreds, or thousands of people to give you their own 'random' number
would it be a numeric sequence containing no recognizable patterns or
regularities, or would it hold patterns and regularities? This is why I created
the HuRandom project.
